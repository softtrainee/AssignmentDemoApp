iOS Assignment
Overview:
Develop an application for iOS to efficiently load and display images in a scrollable grid using the Unsplash API. You are not allowed to use any third-party image-loading library.

Tasks:
  Image Loading: Implement asynchronous image loading from the API URLs.  The scrollable grid should efficiently work with even 10,000 images.
 Caching: Develop a caching mechanism to store images retrieved from the API in memory and/or disk cache for efficient retrieval.
  Error Handling: Handle network errors and image loading failures gracefully when fetching images from the API, providing informative error messages or placeholders for failed image loads.
  Implementation is to be done using Swift.

 Step-by-step and clear instructions should be present in the README file to run the code.
  Effective error handling.
